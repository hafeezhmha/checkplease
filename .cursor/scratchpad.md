# CheckPlease! - A Chess.com Receipt Generator

## Background and Motivation

CheckPlease! is a web application that generates a receipt of a user's stats and recent activity from Chess.com. This provides a fun, shareable summary for chess players to showcase their skills and accomplishments.

The user wants to add fun references from the chess streamer GothamChess to their chess receipt generator application, 'CheckPlease!', to make it more engaging.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **API Integration:** The primary challenge is to switch from the GitHub API to the `Chess.com` Public Data API. This involves understanding the available endpoints, data structures, and any rate limits. The API is read-only and provides player profiles, stats, and game archives.
- **Data Selection:** We need to decide which chess statistics are the most interesting and suitable for a "receipt" format. Key stats will likely include ratings (Blitz, Bullet, Rapid), win/loss/draw records, puzzle ratings, and perhaps a list of recent opponents.
- **UI/UX Redesign:** The user interface needs to be redesigned to reflect the new purpose. This includes changing text, imagery, and the overall layout of the receipt to be chess-themed.
- **"Barcode" Equivalent:** The original app used a barcode. For "CheckPlease!", we can replace this with a QR code that links directly to the user's `Chess.com` profile, making it easy for others to find and challenge them.
- The primary challenge is to integrate the quotes in a way that feels natural within the existing receipt layout.
- The quotes should be varied and selected randomly to keep the experience fresh for users.

## High-level Task Breakdown

The project will be broken down into the following high-level tasks. Each task should be completed and verified before moving to the next.

1.  **Project Setup & Cleanup:**
    -   **Success Criteria:** The project is renamed to "CheckPlease!", and all remnants of the GitHub functionality are removed from the codebase.
2.  **Implement `Chess.com` API Service:**
    -   **Success Criteria:** A new service/function is created that can fetch a user's profile and stats from the `Chess.com` API and return it in a structured format.
3.  **Redesign the Receipt Component:**
    -   **Success Criteria:** The UI is updated to display chess-related stats in a clear and visually appealing receipt format.
4.  **Integrate QR Code Generation:**
    -   **Success Criteria:** A QR code is generated on the receipt that, when scanned, directs to the user's `Chess.com` profile page.
5.  **Final Touches & Deployment Prep:**
    -   **Success Criteria:** The application is fully functional, handles errors gracefully (e.g., user not found), and is ready for deployment.

## Lessons

*This section is for documenting reusable information, such as fixes for common errors or useful library versions.* 
- When a user requests specific icons like "tools" or "coffee", do not substitute with other icons. If the correct icon cannot be found, ask the user for the specific SVG code.
